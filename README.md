# AI Learns to play Tetris 

This project manages and runs a Tetris game with various AI algorithms. It includes implementations for **Greedy AI**, **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) AI**, and **Genetic Algorithm**. The game can be played with different *AI strategies* or *manually*, and it tracks and displays Statistics such as pieces dropped and rows cleared.

- **Genetic Algorithm AI**: Utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve and optimize its performance.
- **Greedy AI**: Implements a heuristic approach to make decisions based on immediate benefits.
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) AI**: Uses MCTS for decision-making by simulating and evaluating potential future moves.

## Project Structure

- **`genetic.py`**: Contains the implementation of the Genetic Algorithm AI. This AI uses a genotype to evaluate board states and determine the best move.
- **`greedy.py`**: Implements the Greedy AI that chooses the move with the minimal cost based on heuristic evaluation.
- **`mcts.py`**: Includes the Monte Carlo Tree Search AI for decision-making using simulations to find the best move.
- **`main.py`**: The entry point of the application. It runs the game with the AI agents.
- **`game.py`**: Contains the core game logic, including the game loop and interaction with the AI agents.
- **`board.py`**: Defines the board representation and manipulation functions.
- **`piece.py`**: Manages the Tetris pieces and their rotations.
- **`genetic_helpers.py`**: Helper functions used by the Genetic Algorithm AI.
